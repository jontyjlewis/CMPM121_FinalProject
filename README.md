 UCSC's CMPM121 Final Project, Fall 2022
 By Jonathan Lewis and Joe Frumenti
 

 ## HOW TO PLAY
 WASD to move
 E to interact
 SPACE to jump (not needed but its there)
 
 ## The Scene/Game Setting
 The Scene we chose to do was the Mystery Scene
 
 The game starts off with the player finding themselves before an altar in a dark, foggy forest setting.  Before them is a large crystal enshrouded in a force field of some kind, preventing the player from touching the crystal.  If the player walks near the force field, a UI pop up gives the player the hint to find 4 crystals of night to end the eternal night.  There is a path layed out that the player can follow through the forest which will take them around the map and to 4 other smaller altar locations with crystals at them.  Once all 4 crystals have been found and destroyed, returning to the main altar shows that the force field has been destroyed and you can approach the main large crystal.  Destroying this main crystal ends the curse of night on the forest and brings the light of day back to the forest and all its splendor.
 
 ## Point Breakdown

 - 5 "clues" hidden in the scene - main clue is given with the force field, find the 4 other crystals to destroy the force field and return to interact with the main crystal
